# Summer 2023 notes
### 2023-06-13
- wrote functions to define home field advantage in two ways: (a) difference in mean home points vs mean away points, and (b) mean home goals vs mean away goals.
- Added these to the league table function from yesterday so it is now returned in the dataframe created by the function
- also calculated the mean and variance of the home field advantage across teams in the leagues
### 2023-06-12
- Wrote a function to calculate for the goals for, goals against, goal difference, points, and games played for every team in the league given the csv file from http://www.football-data.co.uk
- this includes home and away for all categories
- tested this function on 4 premier league seasons and 1 bundersliga season
### 2023-06-11
- Calculated the number of points (Home and Away) for each team in the league and added it to the ongoing table dataframe
- calculated the number of games played by each team and added to the table dataframe
### 2023-06-10
- Read in data from http://www.football-data.co.uk into a data frame for 2022-23 premier league season
- found how many total games were played
- Wrote a function calculating for the total number of goals scored by each team
- Created a table/dataframe that has the goals scored (Home and Away), goals against (Home and Away), and goal difference (Home and Away) for each team in the league 
### 2023-06-08
- wrote a function for a journey with m walks each having n steps
- modeled the walk and journey functions as plots in jullia
### 2023-06-07
- Wrote a function that would resemble a random walk
- wrote function that returned -1 or 1 based on whether random number 0-1 was greater than or less than .5
- Calculated the position after each step using cumalitive sum and stored it in an array
- wrote a function for a walk with n steps
### 2023-06-05
- Went over Chapter 3.3 of Julia data science in depth
- Introduced common data structures and types

### 2023-06-02
- Wrote a function calculating for any fibonacci number
- Wrote a function calculating value of e using a for loop
- Wrote a function calculating value of e using a while loop
- Completed Chapter 3.2 of Julia data science

- Created this repository

### 2023-05-15
