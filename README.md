# Competitive balance of sports leagues

Rishabh Sen and Saunak Sen

Competitive balance is essential for sports leagues to maintain fan engagement and financial success. 
This analysis investigates competitive balance across numerous professional leagues using a metric based 
on the Bradley-Terry probability model. Men's soccer leagues in Europe and North America from 2004-present 
were analyzed, finding second divisions consistently more balanced than first. The MLS proved more 
comparable to European second tiers in parity. Among major U.S. leagues since 2005, the NBA and NFL 
showed far lower balance than MLB, NHL and MLS. Incorporating playoff structures led to the NBAâ€™s lower 
balance being amplified while the NFL became more balanced. The metric also revealed higher parity in 
soccer versus basketball worldwide. Results suggest financial inequality, league format, playoff systems, 
and sports' inherent dynamics substantially impact balance. While limited by its narrow time frame and 
focus on standings over scheduling, the analysis provides valuable comparative insights and contributes 
towards the goal of the optimal viewing experience for fans.
