- Take the first 20 Fibonacci numbers and put them in an Integer array
  (use assignment to an array)
- Square all the first 20 Fibonacci numbers (use map or the broadcast
  operator).
- The limit of the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers is the
  Golden Ratio. Use a `while` loop to calculate the Golden Ratio to 5
  decimal places.
- Plot the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers for the first 100
  Fibonacci numbers.  (Make an array with the ratios, then plot
  using the `Plots` package.)

- Write a function to calculate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci
  sequence.  The integer n should be an argument of the function.
- Write a function to calculate e by summing the first n terms of the
  sequence 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + .... This should use a for loop.
- Write a function to calculate e by summing the above sequence until
  the tersm being added is smaller than a pre-specified number (say
  10^(-8)). This should use a while loop.
