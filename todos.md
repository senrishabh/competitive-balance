- Write a function to calculate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci
  sequence.  The integer n should be an argument of the function.
- Write a function to calculate e by summing the first n terms of the
  sequence 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + .... This should use a for loop.
- Write a function to calculate e by summing the above sequence until
  the tersm being added is smaller than a pre-specified number (say
  10^(-8)). This should use a while loop.
